# PE_Malicious_File_Detection_Using-ML_and_DL

## Overview
This repository contains a sophisticated solution for detecting malicious files using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The project leverages various algorithms to identify potentially harmful files and improve cybersecurity measures.

Features
PE File Analysis: Extracts and processes features from PE files to build a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluation.

Feature Selection Methods:

1) Extra Trees Classifier: Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to rank features based on their importance.
2) Correlation Analysis: Identifies and removes redundant features based on their correlation with the target variable.
3) SelectKBest: Selects the top k features based on statistical tests.
4) Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality by transforming features into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

1) Decision Tree: A tree-based algorithm that makes decisions based on feature splits.
2) Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that improves classification accuracy through averaging.
3) AdaBoost: Boosting algorithm that combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
4) Gradient Boosting: Boosting technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.
5) Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
6) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies instances based on the majority label of their k-nearest neighbors.
7) XGBoost: Optimized gradient boosting algorithm for high-performance and scalability.
8) Logistic Regression: Linear model used for binary classification tasks.

Deep Learning Models:

1) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A broad class of neural networks used for various tasks, including classification and regression.
2) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): A type of ANN where connections between the nodes do not form a cycle, often used for classification and regression tasks.
